                <div class="des">1. Foraging and Hunting: Birds have evolved unique foraging strategies, from seed-eating finches to predatory hawks and eagles.
                    2. Nesting and Breeding: Birds build intricate nests, often using plant material, mud, and other natural materials.
                    3. Roosting and Sleeping: Many birds roost in large groups, often in trees or on cliffs, and have unique sleeping patterns, such as sleeping with only half their brain at a time.

            <div class="des">1. Feeding: Butterflies feed on nectar from flowers, using their long, tube-like proboscis to reach deep into flowers.
                2. Migration: Some butterfly species migrate thousands of kilometers each year, often traveling alone or in large groups.
                3. Roosting: Butterflies roost in trees or bushes, often clustering together in large groups.
                4. Mating and Courtship: Butterflies engage in complex courtship behaviors, including flying displays and pheromone signals.
